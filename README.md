## Smuggler
- HTML smuggling is a sophisticated cyber attack that involves hiding malicious code inside seemingly benign HTML files. The main goal of this attack is to bypass security measures such as content filters and firewalls. This is achieved by using JavaScript blobs and the HTML5 download attribute used with the anchor tag. The attack consists of making a user navigate to a crafted HTML page that automatically downloads a malicious file. The payload is stored in a Blob object, and an Object URL is created with JavaScript to download the malicious file. The attack is particularly dangerous because the payload is delivered in a way that bypasses many security checks
